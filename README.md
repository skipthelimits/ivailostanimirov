Hello! My name is Ivailo Stanimirov, a hobbyist coder.
Teenager, born and living in BulgariaðŸ‡§ðŸ‡¬.
I code moderately fluently in these languages:
 - HTML (though it's arguably not really a language)
 - CSS
 - Python
 - JavaScript (Includes Node.JS, Express.JS, etc.)
 - Batch (used to make a ton of scripts with this one, pretty experienced)
 - VBS
 - (Partially) Rust
 - (Partially) C#
 - (Learning, but not loving it) Java
 - And a few other languages.
I've been doing more websites recently, just wanna practice and do Web Design well for now.
Anyways, that's about it! Thanks for reading!
